# Course Point Types

The canonical set of course point types is defined in `Profile.xlsx` in the
[Garmin FIT SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/download/), as the
`course_point` type.  But that just gives us a list of possible types to use.
The real question is, how do these point types behave when loaded onto Garmin
devices we care about?

Here are how different course point types appear in "Up Ahead" on a Fenix 7:
