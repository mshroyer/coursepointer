# Course Point Types

The canonical set of course point types is defined in `Profile.xlsx` in the
[Garmin FIT SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/download/), as the
`course_point` type.  But that just gives us a list of possible types to use.
The real question is, how do these point types behave when loaded onto Garmin
devices we care about?
