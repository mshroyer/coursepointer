# CoursePointer

A **work in progress** command-line tool that converts routes/tracks and waypoints from GPX files into Garmin FIT course files with "course points". This allows them to appear in lists of upcoming points, including distance and time remaining, when navigating on Garmin devices like Edge bicycle computers and Fenix watches.
